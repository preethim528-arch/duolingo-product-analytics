# Learning Behavior & Premium Conversion on Duolingo

## 📊 Project Overview
This personal product analytics project explores how learner behavior influences premium conversion in a freemium product like Duolingo.  
The goal is to identify high-intent free learners and understand where targeted conversion strategies can drive sustainable premium growth.

---

## ❓ Product Question
**How can Duolingo identify high-intent free learners and convert them to premium at the right moment without disrupting the learning experience?**

---

## 🔍 Analysis Focus
- Learning consistency (daily streaks)
- Engagement depth (lessons completed, session duration)
- Behavioral differences between free and premium users
- Identification of high-intent free users within the freemium funnel
- Potential revenue opportunity from behavior-based targeting

---

## 💡 Key Insight
Learning consistency is the strongest signal of premium intent.  
A subset of free learners already behaves like premium users, indicating a focused and realistic opportunity for targeted feature unlocks or nudges instead of broad discounts.

---

## 📈 Dashboard
The Power BI dashboard visually connects:

**User behavior → Intent → Conversion opportunity → Revenue impact**

It is designed to help product and growth teams quickly understand:
- What differentiates premium users
- Which free users are most likely to convert
- Where premium growth opportunities exist

Screenshots of the dashboard are available in the `/screenshots` folder.
